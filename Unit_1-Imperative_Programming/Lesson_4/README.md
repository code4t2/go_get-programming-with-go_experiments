An opening curly brace `{` introduces a new scope that ends with a closing brace `}`.  
The `case` and `default` keywords also introduce a new scope even though no curly braces are involved.  
The location where a variable is declared determines which scope it’s in.  
Not only is shortcut declaration shorter, you can take it places where `var` can’t go.  
Variables declared on the same line as a `for`, `if`, or `switch` are in scope until the end of that statement.                           
A wide scope is better than a narrow scope in some situations—and vice versa.
